I want to design a fully responsive E-commerce website using React.js (frontend) with the following style guidelines:

Overall Theme

Minimal design → clean layouts, uncluttered sections, no unnecessary elements.

Retro vibe → use retro-inspired fonts (like "Press Start 2P", "VT323", or vintage serif), pastel backgrounds, and muted but playful color palette (creams, soft blues, faded pinks, mustard yellow, etc.).

Lightweight & fast → optimized images, lazy loading for product images, small CSS footprint (TailwindCSS preferred).

Page Layouts

Header / Navbar

Sticky top navigation bar with logo (retro typography).

Minimal links: Home, Shop, Cart, Profile.

Hamburger menu on mobile with smooth slide-in animation.

Hover effects: soft color shifts + underline grow animation.

Home Page

Hero section with retro typography headline and a large faded background image.

Product grid → card layout, 2–4 columns (responsive).

Hover animation on product cards:

Slight scale-up.

Soft shadow transition.

“Add to Cart” button slide-up effect.

Product Detail Page

Large product image with retro-styled frame/border.

Clean product info: title, price, description, stock.

Retro-styled Add to Cart button (big, bold, animated ripple effect).

Cart Page

List of items with product thumbnail + name + quantity control.

Animated removal (slide out when removed).

Total calculation displayed in retro calculator-style font.

Checkout Page

Minimal form (name, address, payment info placeholder).

Smooth input focus effect (border glow or underline animation).

Login/Signup Page

Retro-inspired card with soft background pattern (dots, grids, or stripes).

Smooth transition when switching between login ↔ signup.

Profile Page

User details with order history.

Retro-style table design (alternating faded row colors).

Admin Panel

Clean dashboard with cards for adding/editing products.

Animated modals for forms.

Animations & Transitions

Page transitions → fade in/out or slide transitions using Framer Motion.

Button hover → color shift + shadow grow.

Product images → slight zoom-in on hover.

Retro text effects → glowing neon-style text for titles or hover highlights.

Loading states → retro spinner (pixelated style or ASCII-inspired).

Responsive Design

Mobile-first:

Product grid → 1 column on small screens, 2 columns on tablets, 4 columns on desktop.

Navbar collapses into a hamburger menu with slide-down/slide-in animation.

Checkout and forms → stacked inputs for mobile, side-by-side for desktop.

Desktop:

Full grid layout, plenty of spacing.

Hover animations enabled (disabled/reduced for touch devices).

Color Palette (Retro Inspired)

Background → soft cream #FDF6E3

Primary → faded teal #4ECDC4

Accent → muted mustard #FFB347

Secondary → soft pink #FF6B6B

Text → dark retro brown/charcoal #2E2E2E

Typography

Headings → Retro-styled pixel/arcade font or vintage serif.

Body → Clean sans-serif (Roboto, Inter, or Nunito).

Buttons → Bold uppercase with letter spacing for retro feel.
